# Add-tags-to-github-stars

This is a voting repo. You vote by starring it.

## Why should I star this repository?
If, like me, you want to be able to categorize or tag your github stars, just star this repo.

## Why is it good to be able to tag your stars?

Basically my Github stars are a personal database.

Some of the "rows" contain tools I used in the past, present and future. Some are just repos that deal with topics I'm interested in. Some just caught my eye in any of the numerous discovery channels and I want to get back to them in the future and some a just so cool I must put a little star on them to show their author my respect and admiration.

Not just in the bible but in many other references, stars are used as a metaphor for vast or infinite quantity. 

As it turns out my stars on Github were destined (predestined some might say) to live up to the potential of their name as set by their celestial brethren and grow in numbers.

Being able to just search through my starred repositories is a mighty tool but browsing them is a different story all together... 30 rows per page (?) and I got around 900ish stars now, you do the math. Granted, one may narrow the page count by searching but the problem is that classic search is not the ultimate solution to everything and even google realized that with gmail labels.

When you think about it, tagging or categorizing repositories when you star them is also "search" but the main difference is who decides what the search query will be (you) and when (when you star the repo).

Tags will also pave the way for more creative ways to looks at your starbase not to mention its a massive crowdsourcing facility for grouping all the massive amount of code on github.

In short, I think its going to be pretty useful and whatnot.

If you read this far I thank you for your time and also if you agree with me, I also thank you, in advance for starring this repository.

Github you're awesome.
